## About

I work at [Sungkyunkwan University Graduate School of Business](https://gsb.skku.edu/) (SKK GSB) as an assistant professor in marketing. My research considers how firms should incorporate consumer behavioral biases into pricing and choice architecture design. I conduct both empirical research to tackle the descriptive problems of how certain behaviour occurs, and theoretical research to tackle the prescriptive problems of how firms should respond.
